Supplement to "Introducing R" for PRI workshop January 2013 
===========================================================
*Note: We will refer to the 4 default RStudio pane layout as UL(Upper Left), UR (Upper Right), LR(Lower Right), LL(Lower Left) in this document.*

### Section 2.4
Try using the following statement to make a prettier plot with the ggplot2 package...
```
library(ggplot2)
qplot(z,d, type="l", main="The Standard Normal Density", col.main="cornflowerblue")

```
Use the Export menu in the Plots tab of the LR RStudio pane for easy options to save/copy your plot.

### Section 3.2 

From the RStudio Menu Bar select Project-> Create project. Then select From New Directory.  

Confirm that your working directory is the new directory you created with getwd().

#### To attach or not to attach?
Most R afficionados advise against the use of `attach`.  One of the main reasons is that newly created variables are placed in the global workspace and not related to the attached data.  This means that you could intentionally or inadvertently have two variables with the same name.  This can be confusing.  Consider the following...

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data (cars)
attach(cars)
```
Plot the variable distance, then modify the value of dist and re-plot.

```
plot(dist)
dist<-dist*10
plot(dist) 
```

Which distance did you plot the second time?  View the 'cars' dataframe in your Workspace.  How would you plot the original value?   To understand what's happening issue the command:

```
search()
```
RStudio encourages the use of fully-qualified names with the 'code completion' feature using the 'tab' key.   From the console or an Rscript editing window, practice using this feature.  

save, clear and load
history

### Section 3.4

A few more commands to try:
head(fpe)
tail(fpe)
fpe[sample(nrow(fpe), 10),]
str(fpe)

### Section 5.2

Consider the calculation on page 28:
```
1-pchisq(29.92,10)
```

What if you wanted to calculate this in a program without knowing the values in advance?   This is where extractor functions come in.

Look at the object lrfit generated by the `glm` function.  

* What package creates this object?  
* How can you extract the values?  Read documentation.
* Re-write the calucalation

<!--  1-pchisq(deviance(lrfit), df.residual(lrfit)) -->
