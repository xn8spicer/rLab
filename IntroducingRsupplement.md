Supplement to "Introducing R" for PRI workshop January 2013 
===========================================================
*Note: We will refer to the 4 default RStudio pane layout as UL(Upper Left), UR (Upper Right), LR(Lower Right), LL(Lower Left) in this document.  Be sure to install the packages: ggplot2 and splines.*

### Section 2.2
Programming languages deal with zero division differently.  In some cases any opertation attempting division by zero is prohibited.  R will allow you to proceed, but results vary.  Consider these calcuations...
```
1/0
0/0
-1/0
1/0 == 0/0
(1/0) == (-1/0)
(1/0) == (2/0)
1/0==0/0
# Store these values in a dataframe and print a table
v<-data.frame(c(0/0,1/0,-1/0,1/0==0/0))
table(v)
table(v,useNA='always')
```
Just be aware when you are calculating new variables.

### Section 2.3
For a list of matrix operators visit [http://www.statmethods.net/advstats/matrix.html](http://www.statmethods.net/advstats/matrix.html)

### Section 2.4
Try using the following statement to make a prettier plot with the ggplot2 package...
```
library(ggplot2)
qplot(z,d, type="l", main="The Standard Normal Density", col.main="cornflowerblue")
```

Use the Export menu in the Plots tab of the LR RStudio pane for easy options to save/copy your plot.

### Section 3.2 

#### RStudio Projects

From the RStudio Menu Bar select Project-> Create project. Then select From New Directory.  

Confirm that your working directory is the new directory you created with getwd().

#### Managing data
After reading data from an external source into R, you can save time in future sessions by saving the data as an R data frame.   Then if you clear the data from the workspace, you can retrieve it quickly.   Try saving the fpe data set to your working directory, clear it from your workspace and load it back in from the copy in your working directory.

```
save(fpe, file="fpe.Rdata" )
rm(fpe)
load(file="fpe.Rdata")
```

### Section 3.4

#### A few more commands to try:
What do these do?

```
head(fpe)
tail(fpe)
str(fpe)

# What's the difference?
table(fpe$setting)
table(fpe$effort==0,fpe$setting)
table(fpe$setting[fpe$effort==0])
table(fpe$setting[fpe$effort!=0], fpe$effort[fpe$effort!=0])

# Samples
fpe[sample(nrow(fpe), 10),]
fpe.sub1<-subset(fpe,effort!=0)
```

#### To attach or not to attach?
Most R afficionados advise against the use of `attach`.  One of the main reasons is that newly created variables are placed in the global workspace and not related to the attached data.  This means that you could intentionally or inadvertently have two variables with the same name.  This can be confusing.  Consider the following...


```r
library(ggplot2)
data(cars)
attach(cars)
```

Plot the variable distance, then modify the value of dist and re-plot.

```
plot(dist)
dist<-dist*10
plot(dist) 
```

Which distance did you plot the second time?  View the 'cars' dataframe in your Workspace.  How would you plot the original value?   To understand what's happening issue the command:

```
search()
```
RStudio encourages the use of fully-qualified names with the 'code completion' feature using the 'tab' key.   From the console or an Rscript editing window, practice using this feature.  

### Section 3.5
Note that when you use `Identify` the LR window will tell you that the command is active and you can use `esc` to exit.

RStudio Projects will not automatically clear your data from the worspace.   Close your project and re-open it. 

### Section 5.2

Consider the calculation on page 28:
```
1-pchisq(29.92,10)
```

What if you wanted to calculate this in a program without knowing the values in advance?   This is where extractor functions come in.

Look at the object lrfit generated by the `glm` function.  

* What package creates this object?  
* How can you extract the values?  Read documentation.
* Re-write the calucalation

<!--  1-pchisq(deviance(lrfit), df.residual(lrfit)) -->

### Section 5.4
On page 33, the step command should refer to the object 'lrfit0', not 'additive'
